        <p>
          Vim Awesome wants to be a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date
          directory of Vim plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many recent Vim plugins are announced on Hacker News or specialized
          boards, and have since become widely used. But how does a new user
          find out about these? We wanted to solve that problem and others
          with Vim Awesome &mdash; <strong> an open-sourced community resource
          for discovering new and popular Vim plugins </strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Huh? Vim, the bathroom cleaner?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, Vim is a cleaning product! But it's also a popular text editor
          pre-installed on many Unix systems. Because it's highly extensible,
          there have been thousands of plugins written for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2014, it is highly recommended to install plugins with
          a plugin manager such as
          {' '}<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">
            Vundle
          </a>,
          {' '}<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim">
            NeoBundle
          </a>, or
          {' '}<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">
            Pathogen
          </a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Where does the data come from?</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub, Vim.org, and user submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On GitHub there are more than 30 000 repos that are
          development environment configurations, commonly called
          {' '}<em>dotfiles</em>. From these repos we can extract{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/divad12/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc#L23"
              target="_blank">
            references to Vim plugins (as Git URIs)
          </a>,
          particularly when plugin managers are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are orders of magnitude more Vim users than public
          dotfiles repos on GitHub, it is still a useful source of relative
          usage data.
        </p>
