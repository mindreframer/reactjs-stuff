# React Async

React Async is an addon for React which allows to define and render components
which require a part of its state to be fetched via an asynchronous method (for
example using an XHR request to get data from a server).

We call this type of components *asynchronous components*.

## Concept

In the first place, React Async is a contract for React components which need
part of their state to be fetched asynchronously.

The contract specifies the following requirements:

  * Component can fetch part of its state by specifying
    `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method which takes Node-style callback function
    as an argument.

  * Implementation of `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` can only access properties of
    a component.

  * Component should provide `render()` implementation which can render in
    absence of asynchronous part of the state.

  * The state can be injected into a component by providing `asyncState`
    property. In this case `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method isn't called.
    This should be used for testing purposes only.

Also React Async provides a mixin which implements such contract and a set of
utilities for working with asynchronous components.

## Installation

React Async is packaged on npm:

    % npm install react-async

## Usage

To create an asynchronous component you use a `ReactAsync.Mixin` mixin and
declare `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method:

    var React = require('react')
    var ReactAsync = require('react-async')

    var Component = React.createClass({
      mixins: [ReactAsync.Mixin],

      getInitialStateAsync: function(cb) {
        xhr('/api/data', function(data) {
          cb(null, data)
        }.bind(this))
      },

      render: function() { ... }
    })

The method `getInitialStateAsync` mimics `getInitialState` but can fetch state
asynchronously. The result of the function is mixed in into the component state.

## Rendering async components on server with fetched async state

The problem arises when you want to render UI on server with React.

While React provides `renderComponentToString` function which can produce markup
for a component, this function is synchronous. That means that it can't be used
when you want to get markup from server populated with data.

React Async provides another function `renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState`
which is asynchronous and triggers `getInitialStateAsync` calls in the component
hierarchy.

First, you'd need to install `fibers` package from npm to use that function:

    % npm install fibers

Then use it like:

    ReactAsync.renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState(
      Component(),
      function(err, markup) {
        // send markup to browser
      })

This way allows you to have asynchronous components arbitrary deep in the
hierarchy.

### Manually injecting fetched state

If you'd need more control over how state is injected into your markup you can
pass a third argument to the `renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState` callback
function which contains a snapshot of the current server state:

    ReactAsync.renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState(
      Component(),
      function(err, markup, data) {
        ...
      })

You can then do your own manual injection or use the `injectIntoMarkup` method.
In addition to injecting the current server state, `injectIntoMarkup` can also
reference your client script bundles ensuring server state is available before
they are run:

    ReactAsync.renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState(
      Component(),
      function(err, markup, data) {
        res.send(ReactAsync.injectIntoMarkup(markup, data, ['./client.js']))
      })

This produces the following markup:

      ...

      <script>
        window.__reactAsyncStatePacket = {
          ".1p74iy9hgqo.1.0__5": {
            "message":"Hello"
          }
        }
      </script>
      <script src="./client.js"></script>
    </body>

## API reference

#### **ReactAsync.Mixin**

Components which uses this mixin should define `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method
to fetch a part of its state asynchronously.

#### **ReactAsync.renderComponentToStringWithAsyncState(component, cb)**

Renders component to a markup string while  calling `getInitialStateAsync(cb)`
method of asynchronous components in the component hierarchy.

This guarantees that components will have their state fetched before calling its
`render()` method.

Callback `cb` is called with either two or three arguments (depending on the
arity of the callback itself).

In the case of two arguments `err` and `markup`, async state data will already be
injected into `markup` to reproduce the same UI in a browser.

In the case of three arguments `err`, `markup` and `data`, an API consumer should
inject data manually (for example using `injectIntoMarkup(markup, data,
scripts)` function.

You'd need to have `fibers` package from npm installed to use this function:

    % npm install fibers

#### **ReactAsync.isAsyncComponent(component)**

Returns `true` if a `component` is an asynchronous component.

#### **ReactAsync.prefetchAsyncState(component, cb)**

Prefetch the asynchronous state of a `component` by calling its
`getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method. Note that only an async state of the
component itself would be prefetched but not of its children.

Callback `cb` is called with two arguments `err` and `component`, where
`component` is a clone of a original component with its state injected.

Prefetching should be done before mounting a component into DOM.

#### **ReactAsync.injectIntoMarkup(markup, data, scripts)**

Inject `data` into `markup` as JSON blob. Data will be injected as:

    window.__reactAsyncStatePacket = { ... }

This allows to transfer asynchronous state fetched on server to browser. That
way components in browser won't need to call `getInitialStateAsync(cb)` method
once more.

If `scripts` is passed and is an array then inject `<script src="..."></script>`
into the `markup` for each element of the array.
