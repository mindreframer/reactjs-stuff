                                  # folders. Ex {"json2":[{"json2.js":"json-utils/json2.js"}]. In

      strategy: "packageRoot"     # The copying strategy. "vendorRoot" places all files at the

                                  # in the vendor directory in a folder named for that package.
                                  # "none" will copy the assets into the vendor directory without

                                  # the rest get the "*" strategy. If no "*" is provided,
                                  # "packageRoot" is the assumed default.

                                  # version is loaded.  For instance, you might have jquery 2.0.0
                                  # as a package, but something else depends on 1.8.1.
      pathMod: []                 # pathMod can be an array of strings or a regex. It is used to
                                  # strip full pieces of a path from the output file when the
                                  # selected strategy is "none". If a bower package script is in
                                  # "packageName/lib/js/foo.js" and "pathMod" is set to
                                  # ['js', 'lib'] the output path would have "lib" and "js"
                                  # stripped. Feel free to suggest additions to this based on
                                  # your experience!
